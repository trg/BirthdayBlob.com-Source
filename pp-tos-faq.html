<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">When I click Login, nothing happens</span></strong> -
    I'm aware of this bug, for some reason sometimes my code thinks you're not logged in when you are.  Clearing your cookies fixes it.  Will investigate soon.
</p>

<p><strong>Why don't all my friends show up?</strong> - 
Birthday Blob can only access data that your friends privacy settings allow to be shared, so if a friend does not allow her birthday to be shared, it will not show up on this list.
